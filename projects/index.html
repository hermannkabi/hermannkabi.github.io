          <p class="project-text">In Estonian, this means Christmas list. It was a one-day project so don't expect anything polished but I did have fun with grids. Feel free to copy (and credit me) to create your own christmas list</p>

          <p class="project-text">BookReview is the place where I put up all of the books I read, as well as some review of them. It was a really fun project to create and I will post more books there as I read them.</p>

          <p class="project-text">This is a golf scorecard app. It is available on both Android and iOS. It is my biggest mobile app (I think) and I had lots of fun making it. By the way, it was created as a school project. Have a look!</p>
