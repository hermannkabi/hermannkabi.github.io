# LearningAid


## What?
LearningAid is a project of mine that makes it easy to learn. Learning words is boring - there are often a lot of them and it takes a long time. So just use LearningAid.

## How?
LearingAid is still in development and not available yet. It will be available for Android from the Play Store.

First, create a game, or Helper as they are called in the app.
Then add the words and their meanings to your app.
You can also edit various settings
Now, save your Helper. You can even save it to web for everyone to use.
To play, just tap the Helper in the My Helpers screen. Hold the Helper to edit.
Happy learning!


## When?
The app needs new features and polish, but it is usable at this point so it will be public quite soon, but no promises!

## Who?
This is meant for everyone - for students learning new languages, for people who like to play quizzes and so on.
